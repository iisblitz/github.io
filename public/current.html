Hello! my name is
David Gonzalez
I'm a former manufacturing / supply chain engineer looking for opportunities in web development
I have worked as a process engineer and manufacturing scheduler, with responsabilities related to costs, planning, data analisys and dashboard implementation, I'm looking to leverage this experience and get a job in big tech
01.- About Me


Hi! my name is David, I'm starting out as a web developer and an experienced industrial engineer, I got certified in October 2022 as a full stack developer. I'm intrested in remote job opportunities to start out as a dev, I'm looking for an opportunity tu specialize either as front or backend engineer.

In my previous job I had experience in supply chain (including production planning, procurement, and manufacturing scheduling), quality (writing S&OPs), process engineering and costs. I dropped that career, the logistics for transportation to my job got complicated. I've worked on my own business ever since but the pandemic hitted hard on finances and I started looking for alternatives

This is my current stack
mongodb
sequelize
node.js
express
react
redux
next.js
bootstrap
