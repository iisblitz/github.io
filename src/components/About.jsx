                <p>Short bio:</p>
                <p>Born in Santiago Nuevo Leon, I studied as an industrial engineer and successfully managed manufacturing plants through teamwork and Excel tool development from the ERP for analytics and dashboard design for 6 years. At age 29, I designed my own business from scratch using the business model from manufacturing plants. In 2022, I changed my career to tech to fit my travel-loving lifestyle. I also practice martial arts, led an airsoft team for 6 years, and have been traveling by motorcycle since 2017. I aspire to a lifestyle that revolves around intellectual challenges and traveling as a virtual nomad. Pursuing certifications on relevant technologies is my way of preparing to tackle the most interesting challenges in the tech industry.</p>
